This is a shcool project in which we were tasked to build a GUI for simple fashcard application
like Anki. We were required to:

* Implement the [SM2](https://www.super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm) algorithm
* Build a GUI for users
* Implement basic functionalities throught the UI

The GUI should allow the user to:

* Create, Edit and Delete flashcards
  * Each flashcard a contained **question**, an **answer** and a *hint* (not required)
* Create, Edit and Delete decks of mulitple flashcards
* Save all the informatons across application reruns
* Show flashcards to the user during reminding at intervals following the SM2 algorithm output patterns
